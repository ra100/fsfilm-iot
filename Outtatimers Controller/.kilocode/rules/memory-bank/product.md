# Product Description

## Why This Project Exists

This project creates a physical sci-fi controller for LED lighting effects, providing a tangible interface for controlling dynamic visual displays. It addresses the need for an interactive, standalone device that can manage complex lighting patterns without relying on software applications or network connectivity with possibility to control it remotely over Wi-Fi.

## Problems It Solves

- **Lack of Physical Control**: Many LED effect systems require app-based or computer-based control, limiting accessibility and creating dependency on digital devices.
- **Limited Interactive Options**: Standard LED controllers often lack intuitive physical interfaces for switching between multiple effects.
- **Aesthetic Integration**: Need for a controller that matches the sci-fi aesthetic of the lighting setup, enhancing the overall visual experience.
- **Standalone Operation**: Desire for a self-contained device that operates independently without external power sources or connectivity.
- **Freedom of Control**: Need for more freedom with control over Wi-Fi through simple web app, to be able to modify effects on the fly without need of programming a flashing.

## How It Should Work

The controller uses two buttons to cycle through different lighting effects on a hexagonal arrangement of NeoPixel LEDs. The central LED serves as a status indicator, while the surrounding six LEDs display the active effect. Button presses trigger smooth transitions between modes, with visual feedback confirming the current selection.

## User Experience Goals

- **Intuitive Interaction**: Users should be able to understand and operate the controller without instructions.
- **Responsive Feedback**: Immediate visual response to button presses enhances user confidence.
- **Seamless Transitions**: Smooth effect changes create a polished, professional feel.
- **Reliable Performance**: Consistent operation across different environments and usage patterns.
- **Aesthetic Appeal**: The hexagonal design and LED arrangement should evoke a sci-fi aesthetic that complements the lighting effects.

This product transforms LED control from a technical process into an engaging, physical experience that feels like part of a futuristic interface.
